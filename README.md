## Blackjack VRF

Blackjack VRF, offers a randomized blackjack experience (Player vs the House) same in the modern day gambling experiences that most
casino/crypto casino's tend to offer, while this one is not based on a monetary value but a custom token named (BlackjackToken) BJT.


The play can use functions such as play, draw and stand, to choose his options to continue the game or stand with the draw he got from his 2 first cards,

as there is no ZKP involved with this project, we use the method that the dealer will only have 1 card drawn while the player will draw 2 cards when the function
'play' is called, after the users busts or stands, the second card of the dealer will get drawn, which will result in a win or a loss to the player.


## Why is randomness so important?

Randomness is making sure that every outcome in a game or whatever is 100% verifiable and randomized chainlink's VRF comes to help with that, nowadays with casino's you have 
to trust the casino's and event he people check behind the scene if they are doing what is right or not, 

Lets get to the main point, many crypto casinos are not crypto casino, they only are using a front to deposit crypto and thats it, nothing else is crypto like at these crypto casino's (r*llb*t) :) , fill in the  *  :).
