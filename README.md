## Blackjack VRF

Blackjack VRF, offers a randomized blackjack experience (Player vs the House) same in the modern day gambling experiences that most
casino/crypto casino's tend to offer, while this one is not based on a monetary value but a custom token named (BlackjackToken) BJT.
[Blackjack contract](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1cb6f4bdddb817641546e953c8a3c268040643f7) on sepolia.

The play can use functions such as play, draw and stand, to choose his options to continue the game or stand with the draw he got from his 2 first cards,

as there is no ZKP involved with this project, we use the method that the dealer will only have 1 card drawn while the player will draw 2 cards when the function
'play' is called, after the users busts or stands, the second card of the dealer will get drawn, which will result in a win or a loss to the player.
